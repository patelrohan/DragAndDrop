# DragAndDrop
Sample project demonstrating drag and drop functionality in SwiftUI 

The drag and drop functionality in SwiftUI has undergone significant enhancements in iOS 16. The latest approach involves utilizing the new .draggable and .dropDestination modifiers, which require adopting the newly introduced Transferable protocol in Swift. This project serves as a demonstration of how to effectively implement Drag and Drop features and guides you in conforming your custom objects to the Transferable protocol, enabling seamless integration with Drag and Drop operations.
